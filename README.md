# Machine-Learning
Collections of all assignments and the algorithms implemented in Intro to ML course

### Assignment 1
Implemented and experimented with various linear classifier algorithms including SGD, Coordinate ascent, coordinate descent etc. 

### Assignment 2
Read Various research papers on Recommendation Systems including FastreXML, PfastreXML and Parabel. Finally we modified the FastreXML algorithm to atain better accuracy on the given data set without loosing on time and space efficiency.

### Assignment 3
Implemented a CNN with linear layers to solve the given image classification problem.
